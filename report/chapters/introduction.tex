In this lab, we focus on defense mechanisms against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using eBPF/XDP for real-time packet filtration. 
The lab is divided into four tasks: configuring eBPF/XDP tools, creating a real-time cycle for packet capture, flow metering, classification, and filtration, designing a sample front-end interface for user-friendly interaction with the DDoS defense mechanisms, and deploying Docker containers for Nginx and Apache servers to ensure communication between them. We will download and configure xdp-tools from the official repository, execute example commands, and include screenshots in the report. The lab aims to provide hands-on experience with eBPF/XDP tools, real-time packet processing, and containerization, equipping students with practical skills in network security and system orchestration.
